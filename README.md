# SimplyDone: Task Manager

## Video Demo:  (https://youtu.be/url1wPaF974)

## About the Project
SimplyDone is a web-based task management application developed as the final project for CS50x. The app allows users to register, create and manage tasks and projects, and track their progress. 
The app was built using Flask (Python), SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It is deployed and publicly accessible at: 

ðŸ‘‰  (https://simplydone-snfa.onrender.com)

While the core features are already working, I plan to improve the UI and security and eventually add calendar views, reminders, and task sharing for team collaboration.

## Features
- User registration, login, logout, and password change
- Create, update, and delete tasks
- Project creation and grouping tasks by projects
- Set due dates
- Mark tasks as completed or undone (AJAX-based)
- Design with Bootstrap
- Filter options for todayâ€™s, upcoming, and overdue tasks
- Deployment online for public access on Render
- Contact form with email integration

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Database: SQLAlchemy, SQLite (by default),  PostgreSQL (for deployment), Flask-Migrate for database migrations
- Frontend: HTML, JavaScript (AJAX), Bootstrap5
- Other Tools: Jinja2 templating, python-dotenv for environment variables, Render for deploy


## Files Overview:
- run.py: This is the main application file that initializes the Flask app, sets configurations using environment variables, and defines all routes and views. It also integrates Flask-Migrate and initializes the database.
- models.py: Defines all database models: User, Task, and Project. Relationships and data types are defined using SQLAlchemy. The User model includes password hashing and checking methods.
- enums.py: Defines the enum TaskStatus to categorize task status (e.g., TODO, IN_PROGRESS, DONE).
- templates/: Contains all HTML templates using Jinja2. Main templates include:
      layout.html: Base layout with navigation bar
      index.html: Main dashboard with task list and project sidebar
      login.html, register.html, change_password.html: Authentication views
      task/create_task.html, task/edit_task.html: Task forms
      create_project.html: Project creation form
      contact.html: Contact with me
- static/: Contains static resources like CSS and JavaScript. For instance:
      styles.css: Contains custom styling (empty)
      filters.js, markDone.js, markUndone.js: JavaScript files for filtering and AJAX task updates
- requirements.txt: All Python dependencies needed for running the application
- .env: Stores secret keys and DB connection URI locally during development
- migrations/: Auto-generated by Flask-Migrate to manage database schema changes
- extensions.py: Contains reusable extension logic, specifically the SQLAlchemy database instance (db), so it can be imported cleanly into other modules.
- Procfile: Used for deployment on Render to define the app startup command

## Design Decisions
- Database Choice: SQLite was used for local development due to its simplicity and ease of setup. For deployment on Render, PostgreSQL was chosen, as itâ€™s required by the platform and more suitable for production environments.
- ORM: SQLAlchemy was used as the Object-Relational Mapper to simplify database interactions, enabling more readable and maintainable code when working with models and queries.
- Dynamic Interaction: AJAX was implemented for toggling task completion status, allowing for a smoother user experience without full page reloads.
- Mobile Navigation: On smaller screens, the sidebar is hidden and replaced with a horizontal scrollable row of project buttons at the top of the page for easier access.
- Security: Basic security features are in place, including hashed passwords and session-based authentication. However, the app currently lacks CSRF protection and user roles/permissions, which are planned for future development.

## Local Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/KirylDorakh/task_manager.git
   cd task_manager

2. Install dependencies

   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Create a .env file with the following:

   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///task_manager.db
   MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password

4. Set up the database

   flask db init
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db upgrade

5.	Run the app

      flask run

## AI Usage:
During development, I occasionally used ChatGPT to understand error messages and fix bugs. I also used it to brainstorm UI improvements. 

## Final Notes
This project became larger than expected, but it was important to see it through. Iâ€™m proud of the final result: an app that works, is online, and can be used. You can try it at simplydone-snfa.onrender.com. The source code is on GitHub.

## Future Plans
- Calendar view and reminders
- Team collaboration (task sharing)
- OAuth login (Google, GitHub)
- Email and push notifications
- Stronger security (CSRF tokens, HTTPS-only cookies)
- UI animations and visual polish
